- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anna-TheDataAnalyst and I have about 3 years of experience in extracting, analyzing and visualizing data on user behavior, sales numbers, market research, data quality etc. I have experience working for both startups and already well-established companies in the fields of sports and gambling, education, bike-sharing system, and I'm ready to explore more!
- 👀 I’m interested in helping companies use their data effectively to make data-driven decisions.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the trends in international markets.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects matching my skills, knowledge and interests and where I can give the client more than expected. I prefer working on challenging projects which would allow me to develop myself and also do some research. It could include problem solving tasks, user behavior analysis, market demand research, market basket analysis etc.
